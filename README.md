# Hackathon-Boiler-Plates
Boiler plates for API calls, frameworks, and web apps

I found picking up new frameworks, APIs, and creating a fully functional web app to demo quite time consuming during hackathons, even though they aren't the main component to the hack, this repo is for me to store all my boiler plates so I can get right to my project with out spending time figuring out the little things each time.
